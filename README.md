# Create a Preliminary Check with Targeted Consents on Application Startup

This project shows how to add a Preliminary Check to a React application that checks for consents that must be signed prior to using the application. The application will display consents one at a time until there are no consents left to be signed, at which point it will render the application.

This project complements [this blog post](https://danorlandoblog.com/display-consents-on-application-startup).
